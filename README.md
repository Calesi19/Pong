The game involves a ball that bounces between two parallel columns (paddles) that have vertical movement capabilities. These columns serve to prevent the ball from entering the opposing side, thereby scoring a point. The player that successfully navigates the ball through the opposing paddle scores a point. The game concludes when a player reaches a score of 5 points, subsequently declared the winner. This repository served as good OOP practice. Run __main__.py file to play.
