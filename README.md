# pong_final
I will be making the game "pong" where a ball bounces off two parallel columns (paddles) that move up and down. These columns are trying to bounce the ball into the opposing side, trying to make the opposing paddle miss and not return the ball. The player controlling the paddle that got the ball thrrough the opposing paddle will receive a point. The game plays until a player reaches 5 points and is declared a winner.
